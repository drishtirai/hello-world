# hello-world
I am 18 years old and my name is Drishti Rai. Bennett University in Greater Noida is where I study.
This is my first GitHub repository, and I'm a big fan of open-source, so I'm excited to contribute and learn along the way.

I am the one that always stands up for myself and takes a different path.
I'm going to make sure that no matter how many times I fall, I always get back up and win.
